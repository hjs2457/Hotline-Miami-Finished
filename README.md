# Hotline-Miami-Finished
12th grade CS III solo coding project.
As a huge fan of the Hotline Miami video game series I decided to challenge myself to create my own version of the original game in Java.
I do not own any of the graphics as I screenshotted them out of the original game (and edited out the backgrounds).
I started this project in January 2018 and completed and submitted it in May 2018.

I created this project to challenge myself to expand and apply my knowledge of programming in Java. The main skills I improved as a result of creating this project are: working with several classes and objects to create something big, working with images using trig and rotating them, figuring out how to move everything relative to the player, being able to check and efficiently handle all of the possible collisions, and handling mouse and key events efficiently.

Please be sure to check out the hmgameplay.gif, it showcases what this project/game looks like when ran.
