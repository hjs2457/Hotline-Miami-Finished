# Hotline-Miami-Finished
12th grade solo coding project
As a huge fan of the Hotline Miami games, I wanted to make my own version of the game in Java using much of the same graphics used
in the original game. I essentially made my game as similar as possible to the original.
I do not own any of the graphics used as I screenshotted them out of the original game and then edited the backgrounds out. Nor do I own
the music.
I started this project in January 2018 and finished it in May 2018. The majority of the work was done during the first and last month.
I submitted this as my final project for my CS III H class at Plano Senior High School.
