# Hotline-Miami-Finished
12th grade CS III solo coding project.
As a huge fan of the Hotline Miami video game series I decided to create my own version of the original game in Java.
I do not own any of the graphics as I screenshotted them out of the original game (and edited out the backgrounds).
Be sure to check out the hmgameplay.gif, it showcases what this project/game looks like.
